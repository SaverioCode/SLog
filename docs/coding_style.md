# Coding Style Guide

This document outlines the coding conventions and standards for the Simple-Logger project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase.

## 1. General Philosophy
*   **Simple & Modern**: Use Modern C++ features (C++17/20) where they simplify code, but verify compiler support compatibility.
*   **Readability First**: Code is read much more often than it is written.

## 2. Naming Conventions

## 3. Formatting & Logic
### Loops
*   **Increment Operators**: Use post-increment (`i++`) in `for` loops and general logic unless the logic specifically requires pre-increment (`++i`).
    *   *Correct*: `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)`
    *   *Incorrect*: `for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)`
